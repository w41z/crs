## How to contribute

- Make PR for draft changes. Squash merge it when ready.
  - This helps keep the commit history clean and focused on the final changes.
  - It is also better to seek for approvals from code reviews before merging.
- Use [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) for commit messages.
  - This helps categorize commits and makes it easier to understand the project's history.
  - This also helps automate the release process and generate changelogs.
- Lint and format the code before merging.
  - Use the best tool: [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)!
